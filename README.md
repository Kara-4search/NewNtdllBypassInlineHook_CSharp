# NewNtdllBypassInlineHook

Blog link: working on it

- Base on my other projects down below.
	1. [MappingInjection](https://github.com/Kara-4search/MappingInjection_CSharp)
	2. [SysCall_ShellcodeLoader](https://github.com/Kara-4search/SysCall_ShellcodeLoad_Csharp)
	3. [HookDetection](https://github.com/Kara-4search/HookDetection_CSharp)
	4. [DInvoke_ShellcodeLoader](https://github.com/Kara-4search/DInvoke_shellcodeload_CSharp)
	
- Use a clean version of ntdll.dll, and import function from this ntdll.dll.
- Only testd on Win10/x64, may need some modifications on <MainFunction.cs> to works on x86.
- Steps
	1. Load a fresh new copy of ntdll.dll via file mapping.
	2. Load the copy into memroy and get a "BaseAddress".
	3. Use the "BaseAddress" and function's name, function's RVA to find function's address.
	4. Export the function's address and use the function via "delegate".
	5. Shellcode execute.

- **You could even modify the code to**:
	* Classic process injection.
	* MappingInjection(https://github.com/Kara-4search/MappingInjection_CSharp)
	* APCexecution(https://github.com/Kara-4search/APC_ShellcodeExecution_CSharp)
	* EarlyBirdInjection(https://github.com/Kara-4search/EarlyBirdInjection_CSharp)

- The shellcode below is a messagebox
